This was an assignment from Codetalk.

We were given a psd for the mobile and desktop version of a 1-page site. Our job was to convert this psd into a working one-page website. 

I used webpack with Scss for this project which was optional.

The requirement was to complete the header and the footer only and more if we had the time.

I was able to complete more sections. I did make the sacrifice of only having it optimized for mobile and desktop but not for anything in between. 

If I had more time, I would've added media queries for at least 2 more breakpoints.

Expected deliverables:

Project folder with index.html, styles.css, an images folder with only the modified/resized images in it. Total project folder size should be under 4MB.
The form does not need to work, the navigation should be links to nowhere but the mobile nav should work (but not link). Site should be responsive between 320px to 1440px and match the documents at 320px wide and 1440px wide. You will be left to make sure everything in between works. 

Note: We were asked to complete this project in sections in that it was more important to have 2 complete sections that none of the sections complete.
